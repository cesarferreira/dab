# ADB Client Logic

- The [src/adb_client.rs](mdc:src/adb_client.rs) file defines the `AdbClient` struct, which encapsulates all ADB-related operations.
- Key responsibilities:
  - Device discovery and selection
  - Listing installed apps
  - App operations: open, uninstall, clear data, force kill, download APK, show app info
  - Device operations: show device info, take screenshot, record screen, show network info, enable Wi-Fi/USB, health check
  - Launching URLs or deep links on the device
- Each public method on `AdbClient` corresponds to a CLI command and is called from [src/main.rs](mdc:src/main.rs).
- The `App` struct used for app info is defined in [src/app.rs](mdc:src/app.rs).
