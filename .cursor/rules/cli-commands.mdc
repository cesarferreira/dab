# CLI Commands Reference

- All CLI commands and their arguments are defined in [src/cli.rs](mdc:src/cli.rs) using the `clap` crate.
- The main command parser is the `Cli` struct, with subcommands in the `Commands` enum.
- Supported commands include:
  - `open`: Open an app
  - `uninstall`: Uninstall an app
  - `clear`: Clear app data
  - `force-kill`: Force kill an app
  - `download [--output <path>]`: Download APK
  - `app-info`: Show app info
  - `device`: Show device info
  - `screenshot [--output <path>]`: Take a screenshot
  - `record [--output <path>]`: Record the screen
  - `network`: Show network info
  - `wifi`: Enable ADB over Wi-Fi
  - `usb`: Switch ADB back to USB mode
  - `health`: Device health check
  - `launch <URL>`: Launch a URL or deep link
- Command dispatch and execution logic is handled in [src/main.rs](mdc:src/main.rs), which calls methods on the `AdbClient` struct.
