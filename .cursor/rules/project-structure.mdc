# Project Structure Guide

This project is a Rust CLI tool for automating and managing Android devices via ADB.

- The main entry point is [src/main.rs](mdc:src/main.rs), which handles CLI parsing, device selection, and dispatches commands.
- CLI argument parsing and command definitions are in [src/cli.rs](mdc:src/cli.rs).
- All ADB-related logic and device/app operations are implemented in [src/adb_client.rs](mdc:src/adb_client.rs).
- The [src/app.rs](mdc:src/app.rs) file defines the `App` struct, representing an installed Android app.
- The [README.md](mdc:README.md) provides an overview, features, usage examples, and installation instructions.
- The [extras/t-rec.gif](mdc:extras/t-rec.gif) file is a demo GIF for documentation.

All source code is in the `src/` directory. The project uses [Cargo](mdc:https:/doc.rust-lang.org/cargo) for building and dependency management, with configuration in [Cargo.toml](mdc:Cargo.toml) and [Cargo.lock](mdc:Cargo.lock).
